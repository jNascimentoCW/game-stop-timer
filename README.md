# ⏱️ Stop the Timer Game

A fun and simple game built with **React** where the user must try to stop the timer at the exact moment—without knowing how much time has passed.

This project was developed as part of the course [React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/) on Udemy.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Building UIs using React components  
- Accessing and managing DOM elements with `useRef()`  
- Managing values that don’t trigger re-renders using `useRef()`  
- Creating modals with the native HTML `<dialog>` element  
- Using `showModal()` to display the dialog  
- Sharing refs across components using `forwardRef()`  
- Why `forwardRef()` is still relevant in projects using React versions prior to 19
